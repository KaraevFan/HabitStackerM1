description: "Core context Claude should assume for all work in this repo"
---

We are implementing Habit Stacker (Habit Designer) web prototype.

Primary outcomes through M1:
- Can complete consult and land on a Snapshot (2-line contract).
- Can do Today action (<=2 minutes) and log completion.
- Can Miss and be routed to Recovery next open; Recovery restores Active.
- Minimal persistence is fine but must be reliable for solo daily use.

Tone constraints:
- Calm, non-punitive, no streak-loss framing.
- Use “continuity” language: reps, last done, next step.
