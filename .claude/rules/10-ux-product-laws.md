description: "UX guardrails and interaction rules"
---

UI rules:
- One dominant CTA per screen.
- No multi-step forms on a single screen; prefer stepwise flow.
- Always show the current plan snapshot on entry points (Intent/Plan screen).
- Editing is gated: no tuning until evidence threshold (>=3 reps) unless critical bug.

Copy rules:
- Avoid shame language.
- Normalize misses explicitly.
- Always explain "why this works" briefly at decision points.
