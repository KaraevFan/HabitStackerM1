**Date:** February 3, 2026

**Source:** Daily use testing, Day 2

**Priority:** P1 — Next iteration after reflection fix

## Friction Observed

During M1 daily use testing, three gaps emerged in the tracking/journey experience:

### 1. No Calendar Anchoring

**Problem:** The 7-day progress dots are floating in space. User doesn't know:

- When they started the habit
- What their track record looks like beyond current week
- Which specific days were hits vs. misses

**Why it matters:** Habits are fundamentally about consistency over time. Without a calendar, there's no artifact to feel proud of or accountable to.

**Minimal fix:** Month view with dots on completed days. No fancy interactions needed — just grounding in real dates.

---

### 2. Notifications / Reminders (Data Model Now, Feature Later)

**Problem:** The ritual specifies "8pm daily alarm" but the app can't actually remind the user.

**M1 scope:** Not building push notifications yet. But the timing data from intake ("8pm daily") should be:

- Stored in the habit data model
- Visible in the system view
- Ready for when notifications are implemented

**Don't:** Re-ask the user for reminder timing later. Capture it from intake.

---

### 3. Tracking Section is Barren

**Problem:** We're capturing two rich data streams:

1. Quantitative logs (e.g., ¥10,400/day spending)
2. Qualitative reflections (felt experience, friction notes)

But none of this is visualized. The "Your Progress" section just shows rep count and last done date.

**Opportunity:** Create a visual artifact that makes the journey tangible.

## Proposed Solution: Calendar + Timeline View

### Architecture

```
YOUR JOURNEY tab
├── Month Calendar (grounding)
│   └── Dots on completed days, tap for detail
├── Timeline View (narrative)
│   └── Scrollable cards showing each day's entry
└── Patterns (existing, after 7+ reps)
    └── AI-generated insights
```

### Month Calendar Component

**Visual spec:**

- Standard month grid, current month shown
- Completed days: filled teal dot
- Missed days: empty or subtle indicator
- Future days: neutral
- Today: ring highlight
- Tap any day → shows that day's entry in timeline below

**Data needed:**

- Habit start date
- Array of completion dates
- (Optional) difficulty rating per day for color intensity

### Timeline View Component

**Visual spec:**

- Horizontal scroll of day cards, most recent first
- Each card shows:
    - Date (Mon, Feb 3)
    - Completion status (✓ or missed)
    - Logged data if any ("¥10,400")
    - Reflection snippet if any ("Higher than expected...")
    - Difficulty indicator (1-5 dots or similar)

**Interaction:**

- Tap card → expand to full reflection
- Swipe to scroll through history

**Empty state:**

- Day 1-2: "Your journey is just beginning. Each day adds to your story."
- Encourage without creating pressure

### Integration with Existing "Patterns" Section

Patterns section already exists (appears after 7+ reps). The new calendar/timeline becomes the visual foundation that Patterns annotates.

Example: Calendar shows a dip on weekends → Patterns says "Weekend routines are different. Consider a backup anchor."

## Implementation Notes

### Data Model Additions

```tsx
interface HabitSystem {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // New: Calendar anchoring
  startDate: string;  // ISO date when habit was created
  reminderTime?: string;  // From intake, e.g., "20:00"
  reminderLabel?: string;  // From intake, e.g., "Money check"
}

interface DayEntry {
  date: string;  // ISO date
  completed: boolean;
  completedAt?: string;  // ISO datetime
  loggedValue?: string;  // e.g., "¥10,400"
  reflectionSnippet?: string;  // First ~50 chars of reflection
  difficulty?: number;  // 1-5
  frictionNote?: string;  // From reflection AI
}
```

### Component Structure

```
src/components/journey/
├── JourneyTab.tsx          # Container
├── MonthCalendar.tsx       # Calendar grid
├── DayTimeline.tsx         # Scrollable day cards
├── DayCard.tsx             # Individual day entry
└── PatternsSection.tsx     # Existing, moved here
```

## Priority & Sequencing

1. **P0 (Now):** Post-rep reflection upgrade (in progress)
2. **P1 (This week):** Calendar + Timeline view
3. **P2 (Next week):** Store reminder timing from intake
4. **P3 (M2):** Push notifications

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ]  User can see which days they completed vs. missed
- [ ]  User can see when they started the habit
- [ ]  User can browse past entries and see what they logged/reflected
- [ ]  The journey feels like an artifact worth protecting
- [ ]  Reminder timing is captured from intake (even if not yet used)
