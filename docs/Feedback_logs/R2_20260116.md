# Habit Stacker — UX & Product Feedback (Iteration Draft)

## Key Takeaways / Conceptual Issues (Read First)
- **We Have updated PRD key flows and epics section given our test, read those as well**
- **The flow asks users to choose structure before meaning.**  
  We lock users into cadence, difficulty, or mechanics before helping them decide *what habit they should do* or *why this habit leads to their desired identity or outcome*.

- **The system undersells its core value.**  
  Habit Stacker’s differentiation is expert translation from vague goals → concrete, survivable systems. Right now it behaves like a generic habit configurator instead of a guide with a point of view.

- **Key concepts are introduced too late or without grounding.**  
  Identity, success maps, anchor/action/recovery are shown after decisions are already made, making them feel arbitrary or AI-hallucinated.

- **The system lacks authority and POV.**  
  Nowhere does the product clearly say:  
  *“People like you, aiming for X, usually start with Y for reason Z.”*

- **Users are never clearly told what to do.**  
  There is no single moment where the system says:  
  *“Here is the habit we recommend you start with.”*

- **The “small → big” promise is implied but not explained.**  
  The app never fully demonstrates why tiny actions compound into meaningful outcomes.

## Screen-by-Screen Feedback

### Screen 1 — Start Consult
**Status:** Acceptable baseline.

- Screen is minimal and functional.
- No major issues; polish can come later.
- This is not the bottleneck for perceived value.

**No immediate changes required.**

---

### Screen 2 — Intent
**Core issue:** High effort, low payoff; identity concept is implied but not operationalized.

**Problems**
- Free-form text input asks users to think hard without clear payoff.
- “Identity vote” (James Clear) idea is not made concrete.
- Users are forced to articulate intent before the system helps them think.

**What this screen should do**
- Reduce cognitive load.
- Narrow scope.
- Begin identity framing with system guidance.

**Feedback / Changes**
- Replace free-text-first with **guided intent selection**:
  - Start with **domain selection** (Health, Finances, Home, Relationships, Learning, etc.).
  - Then narrow to **sub-problems** (e.g., “build savings,” “lose weight,” “declutter”).
- Identity framing should be **proposed by the system**, not demanded from the user.
  - e.g., “People who do X usually think of themselves as Y.”
- Free text should be optional or secondary, not mandatory.

---

### Screen 3 — Overview (Success Map)
**Core issue:** This should be the system’s “aha” moment, but it’s currently generic.

**Problems**
- Hard-coded phases (Show Up / Stabilize / Build) are shallow and interchangeable.
- Asking users to “pick where they are” avoids the real work.
- This screen lacks system thinking and expertise.

**What this screen should do**
- Show *what good looks like* over time.
- Explain how small habits lead to meaningful outcomes.
- Build trust in the system’s expertise.

**Feedback / Changes**
- Replace phase picking with a **system-generated success narrative**:
  - “People who become financially independent usually start by doing X.”
  - “Over time, this evolves into Y and Z.”
- Explicitly map:
  - Desired identity/outcome → intermediate behaviors → early rituals.
- User interaction should be acknowledgment (“This fits / doesn’t fit”), not configuration.

---

### Screen 4 — This Week
**Core issue:** Users are choosing difficulty variants without ever choosing the habit itself.

**Problems**
- Options differ by cadence/intensity, not by *behavior*.
- The system never proposes concrete actions.
- No explanation of what “financial planning” or similar actually entails.

**Feedback / Changes**
- This screen should introduce **candidate habits**, not schedules.
  - e.g., “Check one balance,” “Write one target number,” “Log one expense.”
- Options should differ by *type of action*, not just effort.
- The system should explain:
  - Why this habit is the best Week-1 wedge for the stated goal.
- Scheduling and difficulty should come later.

---

### Screen 5 — Planning (Approach Selection)
**Core issue:** Appears personalized but lacks a clear point of view.

**Problems**
- Plans feel randomly generated.
- Weak linkage between:
  - User goal
  - Proposed habit
  - Long-term trajectory

**Feedback / Changes**
- Each plan must clearly answer:
  - “How does this contribute to the larger arc?”
- Fewer options with stronger rationale are preferable.
- The system should explicitly state:
  - “Given your goal and constraints, this is the lowest-friction place to start.”

---

### Screen 6 — Planning Details (Anchor / Action / Prime / Recovery)
**Core issue:** Framework leakage without explanation.

**Problems**
- Concepts are introduced after decisions are made.
- Terminology feels internal and arbitrary.
- AI proposes answers without:
  - User input
  - Best-practice grounding
  - Explanation of tradeoffs
- Important habit design elements are missing (environment, friction reduction).

**Feedback / Changes**
- Introduce a lightweight explanation of the system model *before* showing components.
- Make this a collaborative design step, not AI auto-fill.
- Expand or clarify the model:
  - Anchor, Action, Recovery are good.
  - Environmental design / friction reduction should be acknowledged.
- Allow users to confirm or tweak elements with guidance.

---

### Screen 7 — Confirm
**Core issue:** Strong CTA, but currently a dead end.

**Problems**
- “Start today” does not connect to a runtime experience.
- No sense of continuity into tracking or reflection.

**Feedback / Changes**
- This screen is conceptually correct but incomplete.
- Needs a clear next state:
  - Today view
  - Tracker stub
  - Reflection loop
- Even minimal continuity (“You’ll see this again tomorrow”) would help.

## Gaps vs Product Ideal (Add These Explicitly)

### Missing: System Authority / POV
- The product never clearly states what *works* for people like the user.
- Without this, everything feels interchangeable.

### Missing: Explicit “What To Do” Moment
- No single screen clearly says:
  > “Here is the habit we recommend you start with.”

### Missing: Identity → Action Bridge
- Identity is mentioned but never operationalized.
- There should be a visible bridge:
  - Identity → Behavior → Ritual → Environment → Recovery.

### Missing: Explanation of Why Small Leads to Big
- This is the core differentiation.
- It must be explicitly explained, not implied.

### Missing: Clear Phase Separation
- Consult, design, and execution blur together.
- Stronger boundaries would help:
  - Consult = understanding + mapping
  - Design = choosing the Week-1 system
  - Execute = daily runtime loop
