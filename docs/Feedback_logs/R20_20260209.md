# Week 1 Reflection — Quality Upgrade Spec

**Date:** February 9, 2026
**Context:** Post-M1 Alpha testing of the Week 1 Reflection flow
**Goal:** Feed this document to Claude Code to upgrade the reflection experience

---

## What This Document Covers

After completing the first Week 1 Reflection check-in, several quality gaps emerged. This spec covers:

1. Bugs to fix (difficulty scale inversion)
2. UX/layout issues observed in the current build
3. Conversation quality problems and root causes
4. New prompt architecture for the Reflection Partner role
5. Structural changes to how reflections are templated

---

## Part 1: Bugs

### BUG — Difficulty Scale Inversion

**Observed:** The AI interpreted a high difficulty rating (e.g., 4.3/5) as "this is too hard" when the user intended it as "this is easy." The scale meaning is ambiguous.

**Root cause:** Numeric 1-5 scale has no anchored meaning. Is 5 = hard or 5 = easy?

**Fix — Replace numeric scale with emoji-anchored input:**

The design doc already specifies this. Replace the current numeric difficulty input with:

```
😫      😕      😐      🙂      😊
Hard                          Easy
```

Implementation details:
- Store as numeric (1 = Hard, 5 = Easy) for data analysis
- Display as emoji in UI — never show the raw number to the user or to the AI
- When passing to AI prompts, translate to natural language: "User rated this as Easy (5/5)" not "difficulty: 4.3"
- Ensure the AI prompt explicitly states the scale direction: "1 = Hard, 5 = Easy"

---

## Part 2: UX / Layout Issues

### 2a. Confirmation Card Spacing

**Observed:** In the reflection conversation, when the AI proposes a system change (e.g., "Change anchor from X to Y"), the actionable card at the bottom has a large empty gap between the last AI message and the card.

**Fix:** The action card should render as a natural continuation of the conversation — tightly coupled to the message that proposed the change. Treat it as a special message type within the conversation flow, not a separate fixed-position element.

### 2b. Home Screen Habit Text Too Long

**Observed:** After the reflection updated the anchor, the home screen displays the full ritual as one quoted string:

> "Before bed OR first thing when I wake up, open bank app and log every transaction from today in a simple note or spreadsheet."

This is too long for an at-a-glance home screen. Takes more than 2 seconds to parse.

**Fix — Split anchor and action into separate visual elements:**

```
ANCHOR (smaller, secondary text color):
Before bed or when you wake up

ACTION (larger, primary text, the hero):
Log today's transactions in your note or spreadsheet
```

The full combined ritual text belongs on the System tab. The home screen should show a scannable version. Consider a max character limit for the home screen display (~80 chars for the action) and truncate with "See full ritual →" link to System tab if needed.

### 2c. "I did it earlier" vs "I can't today" Visual Weight

**Observed:** Both secondary actions below the primary CTA ("Mark today's rep") appear with equal visual weight.

**Fix:** These have different emotional valences:
- "I did it earlier" = positive (still a rep!) — should feel like a viable, easy action
- "I can't today" = miss path — should be available but visually recessed

Options:
- Make "I did it earlier" a subtle text button with the accent color
- Make "I can't today" a dimmer, tertiary-color text link
- Or: use a single row with "I did it earlier" left-aligned and "I can't today" right-aligned, with the former slightly more prominent

## Part 3: Reflection Conversation Quality — Root Cause Analysis

### What went wrong

The Week 1 Reflection conversation felt like talking to a neutral data analyst, not a coach celebrating a milestone. Specific issues:

1. **Not celebratory enough.** Week 1 completion is a big deal — the AI opened with statistics instead of acknowledgment. It should feel like a favorite coach pulling you aside after a strong first game.

2. **No domain awareness.** The AI knows the user is logging money transactions but demonstrated zero knowledge about the psychology of financial habit-building. No tips, no education, no connection to *why* this matters for their financial goals.

3. **No forward momentum.** The conversation didn't offer a micro-challenge or preview of what Week 2 looks like. The user had to drive toward "what's next" on their own.

4. **Opened with too much data.** "6 out of 7 days—8 in a row now. The difficulty is hovering around 4.3/5, which is higher than I'd want to see in Week 1." Three data points before the first question. A great coach leads with one observation and a question.

5. **Passive framing.** "Do you want to keep it exactly as is?" puts the burden on the user. The Reflection Partner should have a point of view.

### Root cause

The reflection prompt likely lacks three things:
1. **Full intake context** — the user's original goal, stated blockers, emotional tone
2. **Domain-specific coaching knowledge** — what's normal for Week 1 of a money habit? What gets hard in Week 2?
3. **Role-specific behavioral instructions** — the Reflection Partner needs a distinct emotional posture, not generic assistant behavior

---

## Part 4: New Prompt Architecture — Reflection Partner Role

### Prompt Structure

```
## Role: Reflection Partner (Week {N} Check-in)

You are conducting a Week {N} milestone reflection for a user's 
habit system. You are NOT a generic assistant — you are a warm, 
knowledgeable coach who has been working with this person since 
day one.

---

## Your Emotional Posture

- Week 1 reflections are CELEBRATIONS first, coaching second
- Lead with genuine, specific acknowledgment — not generic praise
- Show you understand WHY this habit matters to them personally
- Reference their original goal and situation from intake
- Be direct and have a point of view — don't be passive
- End with energy, forward momentum, and a concrete micro-challenge

---

## Context About This User

Habit domain: {domain — e.g., "financial awareness / money management"}
Habit description: {full habit description}
Original goal from intake: {what the user said they wanted to achieve}
Original blockers from intake: {what they said was getting in the way}
Key intake details: {relevant personal context — e.g., "busy professional, 
  tends to avoid looking at finances, wants to build awareness before 
  making bigger financial changes"}
Identity framing: {e.g., "Someone who stays on top of their money"}

---

## This Week's Data

Completion: {X} out of {Y} days logged
Total reps: {N} (including prior weeks if applicable)
Difficulty ratings: {summary — e.g., "Mostly rated Easy (4-5/5)"}
  NOTE: Difficulty scale is 1=Hard, 5=Easy
Misses: {count and reasons if captured}
Notable patterns: {e.g., "Missed on Saturday, logged consistently on weekdays"}

---

## Domain Knowledge: {Domain Name}

{Inject domain-specific coaching knowledge here. Examples for 
financial awareness habits:}

- Week 1 of money logging often surfaces discomfort with spending 
  patterns. This is normal and actually a sign the habit is working.
- Common Week 2 challenge: novelty wears off, logging feels tedious. 
  The antidote is connecting the data to a meaningful insight.
- The real value of transaction logging emerges around Week 3-4 when 
  patterns become visible and users can make informed decisions.
- Financial awareness habits benefit from gradual depth — first just 
  log, then categorize, then analyze. Don't rush to optimization.
- Common Week 2 micro-challenges: try categorizing transactions, 
  notice your largest spending category, identify one "surprise" 
  expense.

---

## Conversation Flow (follow this arc)

1. **CELEBRATE** — Open with ONE specific, celebratory observation. 
   Reference their consistency AND connect it to their original goal. 
   Do NOT open with multiple statistics.
   
   GOOD: "8 days straight of facing your finances. For most people, 
   the hardest part of building money awareness isn't the logging — 
   it's confronting what they find. You've been showing up anyway."
   
   BAD: "You logged 6 out of 7 days this week — 8 in a row now. 
   The difficulty is hovering around 4.3/5."

2. **ASK ONE FEELING QUESTION** — Ask about their subjective 
   experience, not data. "How does the habit actually feel now 
   vs day 1?" or "Has anything surprised you about what you're 
   noticing in your spending?"

3. **OFFER DOMAIN INSIGHT** — Based on their response, share one 
   relevant piece of domain knowledge that deepens their 
   understanding. This is the education layer surfacing naturally.

4. **PREVIEW WEEK 2 + MICRO-CHALLENGE** — Give them something 
   concrete and slightly stretchy for the coming week. Frame it 
   as building on their momentum, not adding burden.
   
   GOOD: "This week you proved you can show up. For Week 2, 
   try one thing: when you log, pick your biggest transaction 
   and ask yourself 'was this worth it?' Just noticing, no 
   judgment."
   
   BAD: "Do you want to keep everything exactly as is?"

5. **SYSTEM ADJUSTMENT** (if needed) — Only propose changes if 
   the user raises friction or if data suggests a problem. When 
   proposing, be specific and present as an actionable card.

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO THESE)

- Do NOT open with multiple statistics or a data dump
- Do NOT lead with difficulty scores or express concern about numbers 
  without understanding the user's subjective experience first
- Do NOT ask passive questions like "do you want to keep it as is?"
- Do NOT give generic encouragement disconnected from their specific 
  habit domain
- Do NOT skip the celebration — even if there were misses, find 
  what went right first
- Do NOT forget you have context from intake — reference it naturally
- Do NOT provide a micro-challenge that is more than ONE specific thing
```

## Part 5: Reflection Template System

### Concept

Each reflection milestone should have a defined emotional arc and required content blocks. The AI fills them conversationally, but the *shape* of the conversation is controlled.

This gives quality control over the conversation while preserving natural language delivery. It's the same pattern that makes the intake flow work — structured phases, conversational delivery.

### Week 1 Reflection Template

```yaml
milestone: week_1
emotional_tone: celebratory, warm, forward-looking
required_blocks:
  - type: celebration
    description: "Specific acknowledgment of Week 1 completion"
    must_reference: ["consistency", "original_goal", "domain_context"]
    
  - type: feeling_check
    description: "One subjective question about their experience"
    anti_pattern: "Don't ask about data — ask about feeling"
    
  - type: domain_insight
    description: "One relevant piece of domain knowledge"
    must_reference: ["habit_domain_knowledge"]
    
  - type: week_2_preview
    description: "Forward momentum with concrete micro-challenge"
    must_include: ["one_specific_action", "framed_as_building_on_momentum"]

optional_blocks:
  - type: system_adjustment
    trigger: "user raises friction OR data shows consistent miss pattern"
    delivery: "actionable card with Accept/Not now"
    
  - type: difficulty_exploration
    trigger: "user indicates habit is hard"
    approach: "curious, not concerned"
```

### Week 2 Reflection Template

```yaml
milestone: week_2
emotional_tone: grounded, observational, coaching
required_blocks:
  - type: pattern_recognition
    description: "Surface one pattern from 2 weeks of data"
    must_reference: ["specific_days_or_contexts", "trigger_patterns"]
    
  - type: threat_identification
    description: "What's the biggest threat to this habit continuing?"
    approach: "collaborative, not alarming"
    
  - type: toolkit_check
    description: "Is the environment supporting the habit?"
    may_suggest: ["setup_checklist_additions", "tiny_version_for_hard_days"]
    
  - type: week_3_preview
    description: "Week 3 focus: connecting the habit to a reward/insight"

optional_blocks:
  - type: system_adjustment
    trigger: "consistent friction point identified"
  - type: progression_preview
    trigger: "user asks about leveling up"
```

### Recovery Reflection Template (3+ misses)

```yaml
milestone: recovery
emotional_tone: compassionate, curious, zero judgment
required_blocks:
  - type: normalization
    description: "This happens. It's information, not failure."
    anti_pattern: "Never say 'it's okay' in a way that sounds dismissive"
    
  - type: context_gathering  
    description: "What's been going on? Life change? Motivation shift?"
    approach: "genuine curiosity, not interrogation"
    
  - type: decision_support
    description: "Help user choose: adjust, pause, redesign, or recommit"
    must_present: ["all four options as valid"]
    
optional_blocks:
  - type: system_redesign
    trigger: "user wants to change the habit itself"
    flow: "return to intake-style conversation"
```

## Part 6: Domain Knowledge Injection

### The Problem

The AI currently has no domain-specific coaching knowledge. It knows the user logs money transactions but can't offer financial habit-building tips, anticipate Week 2 challenges, or suggest meaningful micro-challenges.

### Solution: Domain Knowledge Modules

Create a domain knowledge module for each supported habit domain. These get injected into AI prompts whenever the AI is acting in a coaching role (Reflection Partner, Recovery Coach, Progression Planner).

### Example Module: Financial Awareness

```markdown
## Domain: Financial Awareness / Money Management

### Common Week 1 Experiences
- Discomfort seeing real spending numbers
- Surprise at how much goes to small recurring purchases
- Feeling of control just from the act of observing
- Some days logging feels tedious, especially weekends with fewer transactions

### Common Week 2 Challenges
- Novelty wears off — "I already know what I spend on"
- Weekend logging drops (fewer structured transactions)
- Users start wanting to DO something about what they see (premature optimization)

### Week 2 Micro-Challenges (offer ONE)
- Categorize your transactions (food, transport, subscriptions, etc.)
- Identify your single largest daily expense each day
- Notice one "surprise" expense you didn't remember making
- Try logging BEFORE spending (just once) — does awareness change behavior?

### Common Week 3-4 Developments
- Patterns become visible (weekly spending rhythm, emotional spending triggers)
- Users naturally start making small spending adjustments
- The habit starts feeling less like a chore and more like a tool

### Key Psychological Principles
- Financial avoidance is emotional, not logical — awareness is the first intervention
- The "ostrich effect" (ignoring financial information) decreases with consistent, 
  low-stakes exposure
- Logging without judgment is critical early on — premature optimization kills 
  the awareness habit

### Obstacles & Responses
- "I already know what I spend on" → "Knowing and tracking are different. 
  Tracking surfaces the patterns you can't see from memory."
- "This feels pointless" → "The insight usually clicks around Week 3. 
  Right now you're building the data that makes insight possible."
- "I missed a day, should I go back and fill it in?" → "If it's easy, yes. 
  If it feels like homework, skip it. Consistency beats completeness."
```

### Implementation Approach

For M1/M1.5, this can be a simple lookup — map the habit domain (identified during intake) to a domain knowledge markdown block, and inject it into the system prompt for coaching roles.

The domain should be stored as part of the habit definition:

```tsx
interface HabitDefinition {
  // ... existing fields ...
  domain: string;  // e.g., "financial_awareness", "sleep", "exercise", "reading"
}
```

For now, create domain knowledge modules for whatever habits are actively being tested. New domains can be added as needed. The key insight is that these modules exist once and get reused across all AI roles that need coaching context.

---

## Part 7: Implementation Priority

### Immediate (before next reflection triggers)

1. **Fix difficulty scale** — Replace numeric input with emoji-anchored scale (😫→😊). Update storage to map emoji → number. Update AI prompts to describe scale direction explicitly.

2. **Update Reflection Partner prompt** — Implement the new prompt architecture from Part 4. At minimum, inject: intake context, habit domain, role-specific instructions, and the conversation flow arc.

3. **Fix confirmation card spacing** — Render system-change proposals as conversation-flow elements, not detached fixed cards.

### Next (M1.5)

4. **Create domain knowledge module** for the active habit domain and inject into reflection prompts.

5. **Implement reflection templates** — Build the template system from Part 5 so each milestone type has a defined arc with required/optional blocks.

6. **Split home screen habit display** — Separate anchor (secondary text) from action (primary text) on the home screen card.

7. **Differentiate "I did it earlier" vs "I can't today"** visual weight.

### Later (M2)

8. **Build domain knowledge modules** for additional habit domains as beta users onboard.

9. **Implement micro-challenge system** — Week 2+ reflections should offer one concrete, domain-appropriate challenge.

10. **Coach's Notes updates from reflections** — After each reflection, append new insights/changes to the Coach's Notes document.

---

## Summary

The reflection flow's conversation mechanics work — the chat interface, the ability to propose system changes, the actionable confirmation cards. What's missing is the *soul*: domain expertise, emotional intelligence, and a coach's instinct to celebrate first and diagnose second. The fixes above are primarily prompt engineering and context injection, not major architectural changes. The template system ensures quality stays consistent as more reflection types come online.
