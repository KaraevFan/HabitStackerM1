# V0.5 Feedback — Jan 27

## Critical

### 1. Bug: Setup checklist checkboxes don't show visual state
- Clicking checkbox doesn't show checkmark
- Verify: onToggle → store update → re-render chain
- Expected: immediate visual feedback + persistence

### 2. Bug: Grammar error in hero statement
- Shows: "When I tonight after you get home from work, I spend..."
- Should be: "When I get home from work, I spend..."
- Fix: Update intake agent prompt to enforce clean anchor formatting
- Anchor should NOT include time qualifiers like "tonight" awkwardly inserted

### 3. Bug: "1 Reps" should be "1 Rep"
- Simple fix: `${count} ${count === 1 ? 'Rep' : 'Reps'}`

## High Priority

### 4. Conceptual: Separate one-time setup from recurring ritual
Current setup checklist mixes:
- One-time tasks ("Download Meetup app") ✓ correct
- Recurring actions ("Put event in calendar after RSVPing") ✗ should be "Then" step

Fix: 
- Setup checklist = only one-time pre-start tasks
- Recurring post-action = move to HabitSystem.then field
- Display "Then" step in Your System > The Ritual

### 5. UX: Tab placement feels unanchored
Current: Floating pills between card and content
Problem: Doesn't feel native to mobile patterns

Fix options:
A) Bottom tab bar (fixed)
B) Sticky segment below hero card (recommended for v1)
C) Full-width background + divider to anchor visually

### 6. UX: Tab selected state not visible
- Can't tell which tab is currently selected
- Add distinct styling for selected tab (filled bg, underline, or bold)

### 7. UX: Confirmation screen CTA below fold
- Too much content before "Start first rep today" button
- User has to scroll past full setup checklist to commit

Fix options:
A) Collapse checklist to "Setup checklist (5 items) →" 
B) Move CTA above checklist
C) Show checklist on separate follow-up screen

Recommend: Option A — checklist as expandable card

### 8. UX: "Felt understood" rating placement
- Currently at very bottom, easy to miss
- Conflates conversation quality with output quality

Recommend: Ask after user taps "Start first rep" — on confirmation or separate screen

## Medium Priority  

### 9. 7-day dots: Today indicator is subtle
- Ring outline vs filled dots is hard to distinguish
- Consider: thicker ring, accent color, "Today" label, or subtle animation

### 10. Frequency mismatch: Daily dots for potentially weekly habit?
- "Find one meetup and RSVP" may not be a daily behavior
- 7-day dots imply daily tracking
- For v1: OK to leave. Note for future: support weekly habits?

### 11. Self section could show more depth
- Progression: Expand current week with specific focus + mini progress
- Future: Show "What's next" branching options (locked until Week 4)
- Identity: Show evidence/milestones toward identity ("1/4 milestones")

These are enhancements — current version is functional.

## Questions / Verify

### 12. What does System tab show?
- Screenshots only show Self tab content
- Verify System tab has: Ritual, Toolkit, Recovery, Why This Works
- Should not just repeat hero card

### 13. Journey tab content?
- Should show: 7-day dots expanded, photo log (if photos exist)
- Verify this is implemented
